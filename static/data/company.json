            "description": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) raised $8.5 billion in a four-tranche bond offering as the tech giant tapped debt markets at record-low interest rates to fund dividend payments, stock repurchases, among others.The iPhone maker issued the $8.5 billion in debt by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years, according to a Reuters report. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data.\u201cWe intend to use the net proceeds from sales of the notes for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repayment of debt,\u201d Apple said in a preliminary prospectus submitted in a SEC filing.The U.S. central bank has kept interest rates near zero to help the economy recover from the financial hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic and enable businesses to borrow money at cheap rates. Apple joins a list of large corporates taking advantage of cheap borrowing costs. Boeing Co (BA), the ailing planemaker, said this week it raised $25 billion in debt financing and told investors that as a result it would not need to tap the U.S. government for additional funding for now.As of March 28, 2020, Apple had $98 billion of unsecured senior notes and $7.5 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes outstanding but no secured senior debt outstanding, according to the prospectus.The joint book-runners on the debt sale were Goldman Sachs & Co., BofA Securities, J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley.Wall Street analysts have a bullish outlook on Apple\u2019s stock awarding a Strong Buy consensus rating which is based on 27 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. The $320.07 average price target indicates 9.2% upside potential for the shares in the coming 12 months.

            "description": "Due to COVID-19\u2019s impact, expectations were low ahead of Apple\u2019s (AAPL) 2Q:FY20 earnings results. But boosted by a growing Services segment, and despite dipping sales for iPhones and Macs, Apple delivered the goods.In a solid report, Apple announced revenue of $58.31 billion, up year-over-year by 1% and beating the Street\u2019s call for $54.54 billion. Additionally, EPS of $2.55 beat the consensus estimate of $2.26. Although iPhone sales dropped by 7% to $29 billion, in what amounts to a new quarterly record, the company\u2019s services segment reported quarterly revenue of $13.3, an increase of 17% year-over-year. The wearables, home, and accessories segment sales grew to $6.3 billion (up 23%).Moreover, Apple also reported its installed base of active users reached a new all -time high. Although no exact figure was provided, the growing user base has helped accelerate new paid subscriptions; Following 9 consecutive quarters of adding 30 million new paid subscriptions across all platforms, Apple added 35 million new subs this time around.As expected, Apple didn\u2019t provide any guidance, but the promising report is reason enough for Monness analyst Brian White to boost revenue forecasts for the next quarter.The 5-star analyst raised 3Q:FY20\u2019s expected revenue from $51.85 billion up to $53.53 billion, along with raising the EPS forecast from $1.93 to $1.99.Looking further ahead to Apple\u2019s anticipated September launch of its flagship product, the iPhone 12, White acknowledges the launch may be delayed but \u201cwould be surprised,\u201d should it be pushed back to next year.White remains firmly with the bulls, and summarized, \u201cAlthough we expect Apple to remain challenged in the current economic environment, we believe Apple\u2019s strong balance sheet, iconic brand, rapidly growing services business, pipeline of innovations, hardline stance on personal privacy and leadership role during this crisis will allow the company to emerge from this downturn stronger than it entered.Accordingly, White reiterated a Buy on Apple, along with a $370 price target, which implies nearly 26% upside from current levels. (To watch White\u2019s track record, click here)White&#39;s bullish stance on Apple is in line with Wall Street\u2019s view. Apple has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on no less than 27 Buy ratings set in recent weeks. Shares are trading for $293.16, and the stock\u2019s recent strong gains have pushed that price close to the average price target of $320.07, leaving a 9% upside from current levels.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), though not immune to the downturn, largely maintained its year-over-year shipment numbers and also grew its market share. Pandemic Disrupts Smartphone Supply, Demand Overall global smartphone shipments came in at 275.8 million in the first quarter, marking the biggest year-over-year decline on record, according to the IDC report. Unsurprisingly, China led the decline with a 20.3% slump. The quarter saw the onset of the pandemic in China and a ubsequent lockdown in the nation to curb the coronavirus. Western Europe and the U.S. were close behind, with declines of 18.3% and 16.1%, respectively.As the quarter progressed, supply chain issues in China also hurt global shipments, IDC said.&quot;While the supply chain in China started to recover at end of the quarter, as IDC expected, major economies around the world went into complete lockdown causing consumer demand to flatline,&quot; Nabila Popal, research director at the IDC&#39;s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, said in the report. See also:  Apple&#39;s &#39;China Growth Renaissance&#39; Unlikely To Be Hurt By Coronavirus, Analyst Says Apple Fares Better Among Top Smartphone Producers Apple shipped 36.7 million units of smartphones in the first quarter, according to the IDC&#39;s estimates. This represented a mere 0.4% year-over-year drop. The Cupertino, California-based company expanded its market share from 11.8% in the first quarter of 2019 to 13.3% in the first quarter of 2020.In comparison, South Korean electronics giant Samsung shipped 58.3 million units, translating to 21.4% of the total market. This represents a decline from the 23% share Samsung held in the same quarter of last year.Unit shipments fell a steeper 18.9% year-over-year.Source:  IDC Second-place smartphone vendor Huawei saw a contraction in its market share from 18.9% to 17.8%, as it sold 49 million units, a 17.1% year-over-year drop.IDC attributed Apple&#39;s relatively better performance to the iPhone 11&#39;s positive reception.The recent launch of the SE model could bring in more sales, as it that targets the lower-priced segment at a time when cost-conscious buyers could favor budget models in an uncertain economic climate.Apple doesn&#39;t break down iPhone numbers. The company said in its second-quarter results released last week that iPhone revenue fell 6.7% to $28.96 billion.Xiaomi Corp (OTC: XIACF) and Vivo, which took the fourth and fifth positions in the IDC report, grew their market share by 1.9 and 1.6 percentage points, respectively.

The tech giant was one of 10 investment-grade borrowers selling bonds Monday, in what some see as the start of another record month for supply.Companies have been borrowing at a rampant pace to shore up cash during the pandemic, with global lockdowns still largely in effect. Many are tapping the bond markets right after reporting earnings, where it\u2019s become the norm to scrap financial estimates for the rest of the year.The first real wave of issuance got underway in March when the Federal Reserve said it would buy U.S. corporate bonds. It wasn\u2019t until today that the central bank outlined its plans to purchase the securities in the coming days, but it will start with eligible exchange-traded funds first.Today\u2019s investment-grade deals were \u201csimply a continuation of extremely strong supply we saw in April as companies bolster their balance sheets,\u201d said Steven Oh, global global head of credit at Pinebridge Investments LP. \u201cThat supply is meeting robust demand from investors, which is additionally buoyed by forthcoming Fed as buyer.\u201dJoining Apple in the high-grade market was Oneok Inc., a midstream oil and gas company that\u2019s rated one step above junk at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. It\u2019s refinancing debt with $1.5 billion of new bonds due in five, 10 and 30 years.
